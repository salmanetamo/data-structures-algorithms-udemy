Building recursive functions:
1. Identify base case
2. Identify recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed

When to use recursion:
1. Divided into a number of sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem
2. Each instance of the sub-problem is identical in nature
3. The solutions of each sub-problem can be combined to solve the problem at hand
